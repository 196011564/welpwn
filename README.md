# Introduction
A pwn framework aiming at eliminating dull work while scripting and debuging.

If you got any problem, read the code and try to solve it on you own. Then launch an issure if necessary.

## Features
### excelent context control via `ctx` for the binary and its libc
### symbol management via `sym_ctx`(e.g. define a symbol and you can use it in gdb)
### auxilliary functions for debug(e.g. ctx.bases['libc'] will give you the libc base address)

# Install
You need to install pwntools first.
